## Pain

- Until now, I always avoided the constraints and Auto Layout
- When I first tried it, I already saw that this was probably going to kill me
- And now, where the code part is done and the UI needs to get fixed for all devices, I'm here with my suspicion confirmed. 
- **I might kill myself soon** with **5 months of coding work basically thrown away**.
- For real though - how would anyone go about doing constraints for layouts like those?
- I mean, on some UIViewControllers with a button and a label like in those tutorials, no problem at all. But for setups like those? [http://prntscr.com/himh0d](http://prntscr.com/himh0d)
- Whatever I try, it's either conflicting or
- When I finally got it all blue and think "That's it!", but then go to see it on another device, it all looks absolutely horrible
- I think I've watched and read about 30 tutorials on AutoLayout up to now.
- It would be MUCH easier if I just designed the UI for every single iPhone and iPad by it self
- Can anyone direct me anywhere, how I would go about wrapping my head around this bullshit?

## Jargon

- AutoLayout / Auto Layout
- Swift / Swift Language
- Constraint
- UI / User Interface
- Layout
- UIViewController
- Button / UIButton
- Label / UILabel
- Conflicting (Constraint)
- iPhone
- iPad

## Recommends / Buys
- I used to use the visual format for writing AutoLayout constraints, but found that it was a real source of my problems â€“ no auto-complete, and very cumbersome to update any time you need to add in a new element. This all lead it to being very error-prone, so I'd recommend steering clear from that.
