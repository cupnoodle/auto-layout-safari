## Pain
- Struggled with learning AutoLayout for a while now
- I've finished an app, but put off constraints until now
- Im trying in IB to give constraints via Auto layout, but **dear god is it confusing**
- I kinda get it working, but 4 or 5 elements are always off.
- How did you guys go about learning AutoLayout, and if you have any resources, what were they?

## Jargon

- Auto Layout / AutoLayout/ AL
- Constraint / Constraints
- IB / Interface Builder
- Elements

## Recommends / Buys

- Don't be tempted to trial and error this, just methodically go through and do each one.
- Do it through code and not interface builder. It'll make you understand it differently
- I learned in a Devslopes course back when iOS 9 was out.

## Worldview

OP's

- Wanting to complete / ship his app
- Anxious about auto layout constraint (put off constraints until now)
- Auto Layout is so confusing
- Curious about how other tackle on learning auto layout
- Trial and error but to no avail ( I kinda get it working, but 4 or 5 elements are always off)

Commenter's

- When I feel autolayout couldnâ€™t possibly fuck it up, it still **fucks up from time to time**
- **"Autolayout is unpredictable/ non-consistent and didn't perform as I expected"**
- AutoLayout is fairly simple but needs to be done systematically, especially when you are learning.
- Don't be tempted to trial and error Auto Layout, just methodically go through and do each one
- Doing Auto Layout through code makes me understand it differently (easier, simpler)
- IB is awesome (straightforward?) for when you're starting to learn the SDK
- Typing is more fun than moving mouse around
- Using AL in the IB makes me hate it. I definitely did. Something like SnapKit makes it a breeze.
