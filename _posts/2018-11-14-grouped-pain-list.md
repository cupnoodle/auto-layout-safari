## Grouped Pain

- I can't for the life of me understand Auto Layout
- Auto Layout is very confusing to me as well. Took a lot of time to make sense of it. I still don't like it, but i know how to work with it.
- Auto Layout is more frustrating than code signing and developer certificate errors.

----

- I hate autolayout, when I started programming I wasted 1 month on that shit, its horrible for beginners 
- In autolayout you plaster the views in the IB / Interface Builder like a 5 year old child and then you have to select and enter 100 constrains and create a useless buggy mess.
- It would be MUCH easier if I just designed the UI for every single iPhone and iPad by it self
- **I really just wanna code** but I feel like I really need to understand Auto layout before I can

----

- Until now, I always avoided the constraints and Auto Layout
- When I first tried it, I already saw that this was probably going to kill me
- And now, where the code part is done and the UI needs to get fixed for all devices, I'm here with my suspicion confirmed
- I've finished an app, but put off constraints until now

----

- I am trying in Interface Builder to give constraints via Auto layout, but **dear god it is confusing**
- Doing auto layout in the interface builder is a pain in the ass.
- I can not understand when someone says its nicer to do views in autolayout (interface builder) then in code. autolayout is such a strange and screwed abstraction, just the idea that you do part in code and part in IB is grrrrrrr.

----

- How did you guys go about learning AutoLayout, and if you have any resources, what were they?
- How should I go about learning Auto Layout and what not?
- Can anyone direct me anywhere, how I would go about wrapping my head around this bullshit?
- For real though - how would anyone go about doing constraints for layouts like those?
- **I will even pay if anyone is willing to help me out**

----

- Struggled with learning AutoLayout for a while now
- I've been battling with auto layout since I picked up iOS dev a couple of months ago

----

- **I might kill myself soon** with **5 months of coding work basically thrown away**.
- I'm at the point where I'm to say just **fuck it** and go to another language
- At this point **I think it's just not worth it anymore** 
- Any help would be AMAZING this has been driving me nuts all day.
- If that (using workaround on Auto Layout) doesn't work, well **I guess I'll probably just give up on iOS dev**
- Little did I know that Auto Layout would totally fuck me up

----

- I think I've watched and read about 30 tutorials on AutoLayout up to now.
- Watched a bunch of videos and read Apples Documentation **but it isn't clicking for me**
- I mean, on some UIViewControllers with a button and a label like in those tutorials, no problem at all. But for setups like those? [http://prntscr.com/himh0d](http://prntscr.com/himh0d)
- After watching some YouTube videos and trying stuff out I still can’t seem to get it to work the way I want/need it to.
- Apple official docs on Auto Layout don't explain the on key concept you need to understand it, and apple's APIs are so clunky the kind of obscure it.

----

- Whatever I try, it's either conflicting or
- When I finally got it all blue and think "That's it!", but then go to see it on another device, it all looks absolutely horrible
- When I started putting the constraints for the two StackViews **I kept running into "conflicting constraints" error over and over again**
- I kinda get it working, but 4 or 5 elements are always off.
- I have constraints built in and everything but when running **it either it’s off or it’s like so far off** that the objects can not be seen on the screen at all.
- Well, and everything screams bright red when something's wrong. (In Interface Builder)

----

- I feel like it isn't normal at all to spend well over 6 hours trying to get a simple UI to work
- I'm not lying when I say I spent at least 6-7 hours trying to understand StackViews

----

- Auto Layout doesn't work with scrollview
- Scrollview is the trickier one. Rules are a little bit different for this one

----

- when I tried to add a view to it with CGRectMake, **it doesn't work**
- To me **auto layout constraints make very little sense** when it comes to compatibility with setFrame and animation.
- I was just really frustrated with auto layout because it seems really straight forward in IB, but **whenever I try to add animation or a subview (programmatically), it always gets screwed up.**

----

## Ungrouped

- Anxious / care about how layout look (But if I was to get rid of the width constraints then it would not look correct right?)

- In iOS11, I have not been able to find out what the new method of constraining UIViews is, would be nice if Apple included the updated information when they indicate a feature is deprecated (top and bottom layout guides are deprecated)

- Forgotting to set `translatesAutoResizingMasks = false` will totally break autolayout
