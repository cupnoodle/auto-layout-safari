## Pain

- After watching some YouTube videos and trying stuff out I still can’t seem to get it to work the way I want/need it to.
- If anyone is willing to help me out that would be awesome! **I will even pay** if it comes down to that.
- I have constraints built in and everything but when running **it either it’s off or it’s like so far off** that the objects can not be seen on the screen at all.
- Anxious / care about how layout look (But if I was to get rid of the width constraints then it would not look correct right?)

## Jargon

- Auto Layout
- Constraint
- Xcode
- View Controller
- Debugger

## Recommends / Buys

-  I can recommend you to read [Achieving Zen With Auto Layout](https://gumroad.com/l/autolayout) by Justin Williams — it really helped me to get clear vision of autolayout.

## Worldview

- Believe in peer opinion (I was told by one of them that I must fix the auto layout for the ver controllers)
- Self motivated (After watching some YouTube videos and trying stuff out)
- Seek out help when stuck
- Willing to pay for help
- Know error appears in debugger and pasting error to let others solve the problem easier
- Remember that autolayout and constraints describe frames of element through their relationships with other elements and superviews.
