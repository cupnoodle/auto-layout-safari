## Pain

- After watching some YouTube videos and trying stuff out I still can’t seem to get it to work the way I want/need it to.
- If anyone is willing to help me out that would be awesome! I will even pay if it comes down to that.
- I have constraints built in and everything but when running **it either it’s off or it’s like so far off** that the objects can not be seen on the screen at all.
- Anxious / care about how layout look (But if I was to get rid of the width constraints then it would not look correct right?)

## Jargon

- Auto Layout
- Constraint
- Xcode
- View Controller
- Debugger
